View 3D Structure
=================

g3d format
----------

3D genomic structure data can also be displayed at the browser. ``g3d`` is a new format we developped for visualizing 3D structure data in the Browser. ``g3d`` format is a binary format based
in bed-like format of data contains x, y, z coordinates for each genomic bin. Documentations
for how to prepare .g3d file is available at `g3dtools documentation <https://g3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/g3dtools.html>`_.

G3d files can be submitted as custom tracks from ``Tracks -> Custom Tracks``, or using a datahub. Submitting a ``g3d`` track will trigger a new panel opened in the browser, which also contains menu allows you to customize the visulization, like change resolution and decorating the 3D structure using bigwig (like GC percentage) or compartment annotations.

g3d track
---------

From `Tracks` menu, choose `Remote Tracks`, choose `g3d` track type and paste the g3d file url, you can also input a track label which is optional.

.. note:: you can use our `example file <http://target.wustl.edu/dli/tmp/test2.g3d>`_ for testing purpose, this file is converted from data published in `Three-dimensional genome structures of single diploid human cells, Science Vol. 361, Issue 6405, pp. 924-928 <https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6405/924.long>`_ and the original data was obtained from NCBI GEO database.

click the `Submit` button, close the Remote track panel, this is how it looks like with default view:

.. image:: _static/g3d_2.png

By default the 3D viewer contains main and thumbnail viewer, if you zoom/rotate in one of them, both of them will be synchronized. Yellow highlighted region indicates browser region, change region in browser will also change the highlighted region in yellow.

3D viewer menu
--------------

The |g3dmenu| button by default floats to the left of the screen, click it will open the Configuration menu for the 3D visulization, the menu is grouped to control the model data, layout, highlighting & labeling, painting, animation and export. Each group can be clicked to toggle expansion.

.. |g3dmenu| image:: _static/g3d_3.png
    :width: 32

Config 3D model data
--------------------

The `Model data` section can control the resolution of the g3d data. 

.. image:: _static/g3d_6.png

All the models in the g3d file will be listed here and can be displayed or hidden using the eye icon button. The example screenshot below indicates the `maternal` model is hidden by click the its eye icon:

.. image:: _static/g3d_7.png

Config 3D viewer layout
-----------------------

The `Layout` section is used to control the layout of main and thumbnail viewer.

.. image:: _static/g3d_8.png

Change the view layout to `side by side`:

.. image:: _static/g3d_9.png

You can also change how the thumbnail structure looks like, for example, `sphere` style as below:

.. image:: _static/g3d_10.png

Highlighting & labeling
-----------------------

Toggle browser region highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the main viewer would highlight the structure part belongs to current browser region in yellow, the `Highlighting` section is used to control this behaviour, click the `Remove highlight` will turn off the highlighting.

.. image:: _static/g3d_11.png

This is how it looks like when the highlighting is turned off:

.. image:: _static/g3d_12.png

Customize highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Highlighting color and tube thickness can be customized to get a different viewer. As shown below, we changed the color to purple and thickness to 1:

.. image:: _static/g3d_31.png

and this is the updated and view:

.. image:: _static/g3d_32.png

Labeling by gene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gene symbol can be searched for labeling, start with search any gene symbol, the menu will auto complete the search based on users' input.

.. image:: _static/g3d_33.png

choose the isoform wanted:

.. image:: _static/g3d_34.png

the gene will be added as a new label in the label list:

.. image:: _static/g3d_35.png

and shown in 3D view:

.. image:: _static/g3d_36.png

update the display style of the label:

.. image:: _static/g3d_37.png

updated view of the label:

.. image:: _static/g3d_38.png

Labeling by region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User can also manully type a region for highlighting:

.. image:: _static/g3d_39.png

the added label by region search by also be updated in the menu control:

.. image:: _static/g3d_40.png

the view after added region label:

.. image:: _static/g3d_41.png

Upload a file for labeling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A text file contains list of regions/gene symbols can also be uploaded for batch labeling, as shown below, the text file contains content::

    CYP4A22
    chr10:96796528-96829254
    CYP2A6
    CYP3A4
    chr1:47223509-47276522
    CYP1A2

upload this file:

.. image:: _static/g3d_42.png

regions in the file are all labeled:

.. image:: _static/g3d_43.png

Pointing using arrows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

instead of using shapes for labels, arrows can also be used to pointing the region desired. Choose label style as arrow:

.. image:: _static/g3d_44.png

use either gene search or region labeling:

.. image:: _static/g3d_44.png

the new added label will be displayed under arrow list:

.. image:: _static/g3d_45.png

and displayed in 3d viewer:

.. image:: _static/g3d_46.png

config the style of arrow:

.. image:: _static/g3d_47.png

updated arrow style in the viewer:

.. image:: _static/g3d_48.png

Interactivity on tracks
-----------------------

From certain track types like gene and HiC track, users can choose to display gene or HiC anchors on 3D structure directly. As shown below, the tooltip of the gene has ``Show in 3D`` button, click it will add this gene to the label list and highlight it in 3D view:

.. image:: _static/g3d_49.png

.. image:: _static/g3d_50.png

Clicking any dimond on a HiC track will also bring the ``Show in 3D`` button, click it will add both anchors of this contact to the arrow list by default:

.. image:: _static/g3d_51.png

.. image:: _static/g3d_52.png

arrows pointing both anchors will be displayed in 3D view (there are 2 models in this structure, patenal and maternal, so 4 arrows displayed here): 

.. image:: _static/g3d_53.png

Numerical painting on 3D
------------------------

The numerical track in ``bigWig`` format can be used to paint the 3D structure. The `Use loaded tracks` check menu allows user to load either loaded bigWig tracks in browser or submit another bigWig track with file URL.

.. image:: _static/g3d_13.png

If uncheck `Use loaded tracks`, a URL input will be provided for bigWig URL input:

.. image:: _static/g3d_14.png

Here we are using the GC percentage data of `hg38` genome as example, add the `GC Percent` track from `Annotation Tracks`:

.. image:: _static/g3d_15.png

The GC Percent track is added:

.. image:: _static/g3d_16.png

Choose the track from the dropdown menu:

.. image:: _static/g3d_17.png

Click `Paint region` button:

.. image:: _static/g3d_18.png

you can also paint the whole chromosome by click the `Paint chromosome` button:

.. image:: _static/g3d_19.png

Click the color box on the color legend will bring a color palette for choosing colors:

.. image:: _static/g3d_20.png

Choose a different color will rerender the structure with color chosen:

.. image:: _static/g3d_21.png

Paint the whole genome is also doable, click the `Paint genome` button:

.. image:: _static/g3d_22.png

.. note:: by default the color gradient uses the min and max values from the bigwig file, users can also set the min and max value manually by unchecking the ``auto scale`` option.

Click the `Remove paint` button will remove the painting.


Compartment paint on 3D
-----------------------

Compartment calls table file can also be used to paint the 3D structure. Here we are using one ompartment calls data `4DNFIL65C8ZI <https://data.4dnucleome.org/files-processed/4DNFIL65C8ZI/>`_ from 4DN data portal. The file is pretty small about 1MB in size, users can either upload this file or put this file on a website and use the URL. The file can either in raw text file (`example text <https://wangftp.wustl.edu/~dli/tmp/4DNFIL65C8ZI_copy.txt>`_) or in compressed gzip format `example gzipped text <https://wangftp.wustl.edu/~dli/tmp/4DNFIL65C8ZI.txt.gz>`_.

.. image:: _static/g3d_23.png

Uncheck the `Use File URL` box to enable the file upload dialog, the uploaded file can be gzipped or not as well.

.. image:: _static/g3d_24.png

The screenshot below is an example using the compartment calls table mentioned above to paint the whole chromosome, green part indicates compartment A and red part indicates compartment B, color can also be customized. The operations are similar to numerical painting, and the painting can also be removed with provided button.

Animations on 3D
----------------

``g3d`` format is designed to be a container file format, it might contain multiple models from haplotypes or different cells/samples, each model may also contain data at different resolution. `This example file <http://target.wustl.edu/dli/tmp/hic-sync-3d/gm12878_cell1-3-5.g3d>`_ contains 3D structure data from 3 different cell at different resolutions. When there are multiple models available, the 3D viewer can play animation while each model will be displayed as a frame and loop over every model. Add this example as g3d track, this is how it looks like:

.. image:: _static/g3d_27.png

in the `Animation` section, click the `Play` button the animation will start, `Stop` will stop the animation, and `Reset` will reset the viewer to default view style.

.. image:: _static/g3d_28.png

Please check the animation below (speed was adjusted to reduce animation file size for documentation): 

.. image:: _static/g3d_29.gif

Sync 3D structure with dynamic hic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the browser have both dynamic hic track type and animation over 3D structures, there is a way to sync the animation between dynamic hic track and 3D structure. The `Sync dynamic HiC` button enables animation synchronization between dynamic hic and models in 3D structure. Please see the animation below for example:

.. image:: _static/g3d_30.gif

Export 3D images
----------------

The 3D viewer can export current view as image in png format for download. Simplely click the buttons under `Export` section, users can download the image in main and thumbnail viewer.
