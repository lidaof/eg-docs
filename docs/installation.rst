Installation
============

Setup
-----

* Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/

.. note:: Feel free to use any package manager tool on your system for installation (``brew``\ , etc.).

Start the browser
-----------------

#. Enter the ``frontend`` directory
#. Type ``npm install`` (just for the first time)
    This step will install dependent packages.
#. Type ``npm start``

.. warning:: if ``npm install`` gives you error, you might try ``npm install --force``.

That's it! You are done with your mirror site.
The browser is now accessible from http://localhost:3000/browser.

Setup your own backend API (optional)
-------------------------------------

By default, your local browser mirror site uses our API service at ``https://lambda.epigenomegateway.org/v2``,
while if you find the species or assembly you are interested is not listed by our API, you can either contact us to add
it or build your own API. To build your own API, please follow the steps below:

#. Install MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.com/
#. start mongdb server
#. Enter the ``backend`` directory
#. Type ``npm install``

Then prepare your gene annotation files like the ones for ``hg19``, ``mm10`` etc:

#. Make sure MongoDB is running
#. Enter the ``backend`` directory
#. Run ``npm run setup``
    This step will load the gene annotation data to the MongoDB database
#. Type ``npm start``

Now your own backend API is running, change ``AWS_API`` variable to empty string in ``GeneSource.js`` file.
After this you are using your own API for gene annotation tracks and gene search.

Our current API in serice in ``GeneSource.js``:

    export const AWS_API = "https://lambda.epigenomegateway.org/v2";

This API is for testing only:

    https://api.epigenomegateway.org/documentation

.. _Firebase_setup:

Firebase setup
--------------

If you installed a local browser mirror, you also need setup a Firebase instance to enable ``Session`` and ``Go Live``
function, signup a Firebase account at https://firebase.google.com/, which is free.

Create a ``.env`` file under ``frontend/`` folder with following content::

    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY="Your own info"
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DOMAIN="Your own info"
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE="Your own info"
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="Your own info"

The detailed steps of how to get the information above are illustrated in the following screenshots:

Signup a firebase account at Google if you don't have one, then login into your account, create a new prioject:

.. image:: _static/fire1.png

Type in the project name and click the Create project button:

.. image:: _static/fire2.png

Click the Web button to add a Web app:

.. image:: _static/fire3.png

Type in a web app name and click the Register app button:

.. image:: _static/fire4.png

The firebase configuration info will be displayed:

.. image:: _static/fire5.png

.. _use_without_Firebase:

Use without firebase
====================

Firebase setup is necessary for using with Session and Live function, if browser mirror users think they won't be necessary, the firebase
setup setup can be avoided then.

In the ``frontend`` folder, create a ``.env`` file, add the line below:

    REACT_APP_NO_FIREBASE=1

rerun ``npm start``, the browser will start without session/live function.


Use Docker
==========

The browser is also available as Docker images, to run the browser instance,
get Docker from https://www.docker.com/, our official docker image page is
at https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/epgg/eg-react, the image is based
on Ubuntu 18.04, to run the image, run following commands::

    docker run -it -p 3000:3000 epgg/eg-react

.. note:: The first 3000 port is the port will be used on your local computer, you can
          change it to any other port.

After the docker image is running, to start the browser::

    cd eg-react/frontend
    npm start

Open your web browser and locate to http://localhost:3000 to see the browser.

Embedding
=========

To embed the browser in any HTML file, create a HTML page with following contents: (the example shows how to embed a mouse browser with 2 bigWig tracks from ENCODE data portal)

.. code-block:: html

    <html lang="en">
    <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">

        renderBrowserInElement(contents, container);
    </script> 
    </body>
    </html>

The key API is the function ``renderBrowserInElement``, it accepts the contents array as first argument, and container as second argument which is a DOM element.

Frontend code architeture
==========================

.. note:: This section explains how frontend code is organized, intend to be used for development purpose.
          Regular browser users don't need to care about this section.

Quick tour
----------

The client code is in the ``frontend`` folder.  Here is a quick tour of ``frontend/src``\ :

* ``components``\ : All React components.

  * ``genomeNavigator``\ : The navigation bar at the top that allows users to navigate
  * ``track``\ : Track-related components
  * ``trackManagers``\ : UI that manages adding tracks

* ``dataSources``\ : API calls, AJAX calls, database connections, etc. that get data to display.
* ``model``\ : Data models.
* ``stories``\ : Stories for Storybook on which unit tests depend.
* ``vendor``\ : 3rd-party libraries that are not in NPM.

Suggested order of reading
--------------------------

If you plan to understand the app as a whole here is a suggested order to read the code in:

#. ``Feature``\ : A feature or annotation in the genome.
#. ``NavigationContext``\ : A list of ``Feature``\ s  that represent everywhere a user can navigate. If the ``Feature``\ s are
   actually entire chromosomes then the user can effectively navigate the whole genome.
#. ``DisplayedRegionModel``\ : An interval in a ``NavigationContext``\ .
#. ``App``\ : The root component of the app.
#. From ``App``\ , descend into interested components.

Making a new track type
-----------------------

Make a new TrackConfig
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make a new class that extends ``TrackConfig``\ or one of its subclasses. This class packages many essential track
characteristics:

* ``getComponent()`` - Gets the component that renders the main visualizer and legend of the track.
* ``getMenuComponents()`` - Specifies context menu items in an array of components. You can choose existing ones
  in the ``contextMenu`` directory or make new ones.
* ``getOptions()`` - The visualizer probably renders with default options like a color. This method returns a plain
  object containing those options.

You do not have to implement these methods immediately as the base ``TrackConfig`` class provides minimal defaults.
Just work on making the browser render *some* temporary placeholder at first.

Specify when to use the TrackConfig
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Import your new TrackConfig into ``trackConfig/getTrackConfig.js``.
#. Add an appropriate entry to ``TYPE_NAME_TO_SUBTYPE``\ , which maps track type name to track renderer.

Write a new track visualizer component (implement ``getComponent()``\ )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Make a new component expecting to receive a bunch of props from ``TrackContainer``. ``Track.js`` documents the props
   to expect.
#. If you need data assume it will come through the ``data`` prop. We will add data fetch in the next step.
#. Your new component may ``render`` anything though it is **highly** recommended you render a ``<Track>`` component, if
   not one of the more specialized components like ``<AnnotationTrack>`` or ``<NumericalTrack>``.  Pass *all* track container
   props to these sub-components.
#. In addition to track container props you need to provide certain props to these sub-components, all of which the
   respective files document.

   * For example, ``<Track>`` requires a legend and visualizer element. Use the track container props, which includes
     view region and width, to render a visualizer and pass it to ``<Track>``.

Add data fetch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Available data sources are in the ``dataSources`` folder. If none of them fulfill your needs, write a new class that
fulfills the interface of ``DataSource.js``. More can be found in that file.

How do we give your visualizer data?  `Higher-order components <https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html>`_\ !
``track/commonComponents`` contains track-specific HOCs; their names start with ``config-`` or ``with-``.

``configStaticDataSource`` requests a callback that returns a ``DataSource`` and then returns a *function* that wraps React
components.  After you use this function, a component will automatically receive three props ``data``\ , ``isLoading``\ , and
``error``.  These update with the browser's current view region.  In particular, the HOC guarantees synchronization of the
``data`` prop with the current view region if ``isLoading`` is false.

2.  Specify context menu components (implement ``getMenuComponents()``\ )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify context menu items with an array of components. You can choose existing ones in the ``contextMenu`` directory or
make new ones.

* Make sure the method returns Component *classes*\ , not component instances.

3.  Specify default options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default option objects look like the ``options`` prop of ``TrackModel`` objects. Context menu items will read these options
if the track model does not specify them. Make sure these options are consistent with the way you are rendering your
track component! The ``configOptionMerging`` HOC should help with that.

Once you have a default options object, call ``setDefaultOptions()`` in the constructor of ``TrackConfig`` to use them.

Performance tips
----------------

Querying the width or height of any element, for example through ``clientWidth`` or ``getBoundingClientRect()``\ is slow.
Such queries take on the order of 2 to 20 ms. While it is fine to do it once or twice, avoid doing it in a loop.
Suppose you aim to plot 500 data points on a SVG and for each point you query the SVG's width. That is already a
second or more of computation -- very noticable to the user!

React (and other) gotchas
-------------------------

* On Macs, control + click is the same as a right click which fires a ``contextmenu`` event. Note that ``click`` events
  do not fire on ``contextmenu`` events. The ``mousedown`` and ``mouseup`` events will still fire though.
* When using native DOM events they take priority over React events. This is because React waits for events to bubble
  to the root component before handling them. This can cause undesirable effects: for example, calling
  ``stopPropagation()`` on a React event will not actually stop native events. This StackOverflow post may also help if you
  have propagation problems: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24415631/reactjs-syntheticevent-stoppropagation-only-works-with-react-events
* React *always* unmounts components if their parents change type. The ``Reparentable`` component works around this by
  using app-unique IDs, but it can cause side effects with React's native events. Use with care.
* Webpack does not support circular dependencies, and while compilation may be successful, an import may resolve as
  ``undefined`` at runtime.

Lessons trying to refactor into WebWorkers
------------------------------------------

#. Data fetch and track display options are intimately related. For example, what if someone wants HiC data and
   selects the 5KB resolution option?
#. Thus, for each track type, we have one object that gets the track component, default rendering options, and data
   fetch/processing.
#. Webpack hangs forever if it encounters a cyclic dependency involving a webworker.
#. The code as in (2) causes a cyclic depdendency. This cycle is [config object] --> [data source] --> [worker] -->
   [track config deserializer] --> [config object]
#. We cannot have our cake and eat it too.

Unfortunately, this means we cannot pipeline all expensive computation in worker context, while also ensuring track
component and data source live in the same place.
